"""Merge partial updates into canonical draft state.

Merge rules
-----------
1. ``extracted_fields`` values are merged into ``collected_data``.
2. Backend-derived protected fields are **never** overwritten by LLM extraction.
3. Low-confidence extractions (below ``_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD``) are silently skipped.
4. When an extraction changes a field that was already known, the old value and
   timestamp are appended to ``collected_data["_corrections"]`` so every user
   correction is auditable.
5. ``collected_data`` is the single source of truth for the request draft.
